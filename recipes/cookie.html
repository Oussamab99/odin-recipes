    <h1>COOKIE</h1>
    <img src="cookie.png" alt="COOKIE">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Who doesn't like a chocolate striped cookie? These copycat fudge stripe cookies taste just like your childhood Keebler favorites - but improved with real chocolate and an all-butter cookie. <br>
    They're made with a simple sugar cookie dough that is very easy to work with and roll out. I used semisweet chocolate to echo the sweeter taste of the Keebler originals, but you can of course use any chocolate you like.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine butter and sugar in a stand mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides of the mixing bowl once or twice. Add egg, vanilla, and salt; beat until well-incorporated, about 30 seconds. Reduce mixer speed to low and gradually add flour, beating on low until just combined, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half, and flatten each half into a 1/2-inch-thick disk. (Disks will be about 12.5 oz. each.) Wrap each disk in plastic wrap, and chill until firm, at least 30 minutes or up to 2 days.</li>
        <li>Line two baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.</li>
        <li>Working with one disk at a time, roll dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. If desired, prick the dough with a docking tool or run over the dough with an embossed rolling pin to create a decorative texture. If you do not have a docking or decorating tool, use a meat mallet to emboss the dough: apply the mallet textured-side down and lightly tap the center of the smooth side with the heel of your hand, and repeat, being sure to line up decorative scores.</li>
        <li>Cut out rounds with a 2-inch round cutter. Place rounds 1-inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with second dough disk, then gather all dough scraps and discard. Using a 1/2-inch cutter or piping tip, cut out and remove the center of each dough round to create a donut shape. Reserve any extra dough for another use. Chill cut-out cookies until firm, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
